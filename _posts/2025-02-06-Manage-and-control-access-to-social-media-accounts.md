Managing access to **social media accounts** in a **large enterprise** with **multiple accounts** across platforms, while also granting access to **third-party partners**, requires a robust and secure solution. Below are the **best practices** and **tools** to achieve this:

---

### **1. Centralized Social Media Management Platform**
Use a **Social Media Management (SMM) platform** that supports **enterprise-grade features**, including **SSO integration**, **role-based access control (RBAC)**, and **third-party collaboration**.

#### **Top Tools:**
1. **Hootsuite Enterprise:**
   - Supports SSO (e.g., SAML, OAuth).
   - Role-based access control for internal teams and external partners.
   - Advanced analytics and reporting.

2. **Sprout Social:**
   - SSO integration (e.g., Okta, Azure AD).
   - Granular permissions for teams and external collaborators.
   - Unified inbox for managing messages and comments.

3. **Buffer (for Enterprise):**
   - SSO support.
   - Team collaboration features.
   - Simple and intuitive interface.

4. **HubSpot (Social Media Tools):**
   - SSO integration with CRM.
   - Advanced automation and reporting.
   - Role-based access for teams and partners.

5. **Agorapulse:**
   - SSO support.
   - Role-based permissions for internal and external users.
   - Social inbox and scheduling features.

### **2. Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**
Integrate your SMM platform with your enterprise **SSO provider** (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin) to ensure secure and centralized access.

#### **Steps to Enable SSO:**
1. **Configure SSO in the SMM Platform:**
   - Go to the platform's settings and enable SSO.
   - Provide your IdP's metadata (e.g., SAML certificate, SSO URL).
2. **Map User Attributes:**
   - Ensure user roles and permissions are mapped correctly.
3. **Test SSO:**
   - Verify that users can log in using their enterprise credentials.

---

### **3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
Implement **RBAC** to define what users (internal and external) can do within the SMM platform.

#### **Common Roles:**
- **Admin:** Full access to all accounts and settings.
- **Content Creator:** Can create and schedule posts but cannot publish.
- **Analyst:** Can view analytics and reports but cannot post.
- **Moderator:** Can respond to comments and messages but cannot create posts.
- **Partner:** Limited access to specific accounts or features.

#### **How to Implement RBAC:**
- Use the SMM platform's built-in role management features.
- Assign roles based on responsibilities (e.g., internal team vs. third-party partners).

---

### **4. Third-Party Access Management**
Grant **limited access** to third-party partners while maintaining control and security.

#### **Best Practices:**
1. **Use Partner Roles:**
   - Create custom roles for partners with limited permissions (e.g., view-only access or access to specific accounts).
2. **Audit Access Regularly:**
   - Review and update partner permissions periodically.
3. **Use Separate Accounts:**
   - Create separate accounts for partners to avoid sharing internal credentials.
4. **Monitor Activity:**
   - Use the SMM platform's audit logs to track partner activity.

---

### **5. Secure Password Management**
Use a **password manager** to securely store and share credentials for social media accounts.

#### **Top Tools:**
- **LastPass**
- **1Password**
- **Dashlane**

#### **How to Use:**
- Store social media account credentials in the password manager.
- Share credentials securely with internal teams and partners.

---

### **6. Approval Workflows**
Implement **approval workflows** to ensure all posts and actions are reviewed before publishing.

#### **How to Set Up:**
- Use the SMM platform's approval features.
- Define a workflow (e.g., content creator â†’ manager â†’ admin).

---

### **7. Monitor and Analyze Performance**
Use the SMM platform's **analytics and reporting tools** to track performance and identify trends.

#### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- Engagement (likes, comments, shares).
- Reach and impressions.
- Conversions (leads, sales).
- Sentiment analysis.

---

### **8. Backup and Recovery**
Regularly back up your social media data and configurations.

#### **How to Back Up:**
- Use the SMM platform's export features.
- Store backups securely (e.g., cloud storage, encrypted drives).

---

### **9. Training and Documentation**
Train your team and partners on how to use the SMM platform securely and effectively.

#### **Training Topics:**
- How to use the SMM platform.
- Social media policies and compliance.
- Crisis management and escalation procedures.

---

### **10. Example Workflow**
1. **Content Creation:**
   - A content creator drafts posts and schedules them in the SMM platform.
2. **Approval:**
   - The post is reviewed and approved by a manager or compliance officer.
3. **Publishing:**
   - The approved post is published across all relevant platforms.
4. **Monitoring:**
   - A moderator monitors comments and messages, responding as needed.
5. **Reporting:**
   - An analyst generates performance reports and shares insights with the team.

### **Recommended Solution**
For a **large enterprise** with **multiple accounts** and **third-party partners**, I recommend using **Hootsuite Enterprise** or **Sprout Social** with **SSO integration** and **RBAC**. These platforms offer the necessary features to securely manage access, collaborate with partners, and monitor performance.
