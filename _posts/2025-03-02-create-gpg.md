Creating a GPG key involves generating a primary key pair (public and private keys) and optionally adding subkeys for specific purposes like encryption or signing. Below are the steps to create a GPG key using the `gpg` command-line tool. I’ll assume you have GPG installed on your system. If not, let me know your operating system, and I can guide you through the installation.

### Steps to Create a GPG Key

1. **Start the Key Generation Process**
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```
   This launches an interactive key generation wizard.

2. **Choose Key Type**
   You’ll see a prompt like this:
   ```
   Please select what kind of key you want:
      (1) RSA and RSA (default)
      (2) DSA and Elgamal
      (3) DSA (sign only)
      (4) RSA (sign only)
   Your selection?
   ```
   - Press `1` (or Enter) for the default **RSA and RSA**. This creates an RSA primary key (for signing and certification) and an RSA subkey (for encryption).
   - Other options are less common today; RSA is widely supported and secure.

3. **Specify Key Size**
   Next, you’ll be asked for the key size:
   ```
   Please specify how long the key should be:
      (2048) RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
   What keysize do you want? (2048)
   ```
   - Enter `4096` for maximum security (recommended for modern use) or press Enter for the default (`2048`).
   - Larger keys (e.g., 4096 bits) are more secure but slower.

4. **Set Key Expiration**
   Decide how long the key should be valid:
   ```
   Please specify how long the key should be valid.
            0 = key does not expire
         <n>  = key expires in n days
         <n>w = key expires in n weeks
         <n>m = key expires in n months
         <n>y = key expires in n years
   Key is valid for? (0)
   ```
   - Enter `0` for no expiration (common for personal use) or specify a duration (e.g., `2y` for 2 years).
   - You can extend or revoke the key later if needed.

   Confirm with:
   ```
   Key expires at [date] (or "Key does not expire")
   Is this correct? (y/N)
   ```
   Type `y` and press Enter.

5. **Enter User Information**
   Provide details for the key’s identity:
   ```
   GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

   Real name: 
   ```
   - **Real name**: Enter your name (e.g., `Alice Smith`).
   - **Email address**: Enter your email (e.g., `alice@example.com`).
   - **Comment**: Add an optional comment (e.g., `Work Key`) or leave blank by pressing Enter.

   Example:
   ```
   Real name: Alice Smith
   Email address: alice@example.com
   Comment: 
   ```
   You’ll see:
   ```
   You selected this USER-ID:
       "Alice Smith <alice@example.com>"

   Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?
   ```
   Type `O` (for Okay) and press Enter to proceed.

6. **Set a Passphrase**
   You’ll be prompted to enter a passphrase:
   ```
   Enter passphrase: 
   Repeat passphrase: 
   ```
   - Choose a strong, unique passphrase to protect your private key.
   - Enter it twice. You’ll need this passphrase for signing, decryption, or exporting the private key later.

7. **Generate the Key**
   GPG will now generate the key pair. This may take a few moments, especially with larger key sizes:
   ```
   We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
   some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
   disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
   generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
   ```
   - Move your mouse, type randomly, or run some disk activity to help with entropy.

   Once complete, you’ll see output like:
   ```
   gpg: key 1234567890ABCDEF marked as ultimately trusted
   gpg: directory '/home/user/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d' created
   gpg: revocation certificate created
   public and secret key created and signed.
   ```

8. **Verify the Key**
   Check your new key:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-keys
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   pub   rsa4096 2025-03-03 [SC] [expires: 2027-03-03]
         1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   uid           [ultimate] Alice Smith <alice@example.com>
   sub   rsa4096 2025-03-03 [E] [expires: 2027-03-03]
   ```
   - `pub`: Primary key (signing and certification, `[SC]`).
   - `sub`: Subkey (encryption, `[E]`).

9. **Backup Your Key (Optional but Recommended)**
   Export your public and private keys for safekeeping:
   - Public key:
     ```bash
     gpg --armor --export 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 > alice_public.asc
     ```
   - Private key:
     ```bash
     gpg --armor --export-secret-keys 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 > alice_private.asc
     ```
   Store these files securely (e.g., on an encrypted USB drive).

10. **Save the Revocation Certificate (Optional)**
    GPG generates a revocation certificate in `~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/`. Back it up:
    ```bash
    cp ~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678.rev ~/secure_location/
    ```
    Use this to revoke your key if it’s compromised.

### Notes
- **Key ID**: Replace `1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678` with your actual key fingerprint from the output.
- **Subkeys**: The default setup creates one encryption subkey. You can add more subkeys later (e.g., for signing) using `gpg --edit-key`.
- **Security**: Never share your private key (`alice_private.asc`) or passphrase.
