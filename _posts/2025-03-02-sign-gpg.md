Signing with a GPG key allows you to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message, file, or data, proving it came from you and hasn’t been altered. Below are the steps to sign something using your GPG key with the `gpg` command-line tool. I’ll cover signing a file, but the process can be adapted for messages or other data.

### Steps to Sign with a GPG Key

1. **Identify Your GPG Key**
   First, ensure you know the key you want to use for signing. List your secret keys:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-secret-keys
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   sec   rsa4096 2025-03-03 [SC] [expires: 2027-03-03]
         1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   ssb   rsa2048 2025-03-03 [E]
         FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98
   ```
   - `sec` is your primary secret key (used for signing by default, marked `[SC]` for signing and certification).
   - `ssb` is a subkey (e.g., for encryption `[E]`; signing subkeys would be `[S]`).
   - Note the key ID (e.g., `1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678`).

2. **Sign a File**
   To sign a file, use the `gpg --sign` or `gpg --detach-sign` command. Here are the two common methods:

   #### Option 1: Sign and Embed (Combined Signature)
   This creates a single file containing both the original content and the signature:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --sign myfile.txt
   ```
   - `--armor`: Outputs the signature in ASCII-armored format (readable text).
   - `myfile.txt`: The file you want to sign.
   - You’ll be prompted for your passphrase.

   Output: A file named `myfile.txt.gpg` is created. This is a binary file unless `--armor` is used, in which case it’s `myfile.txt.asc`.

   #### Option 2: Detached Signature (Separate File)
   This creates a separate signature file, leaving the original file unchanged:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --detach-sign myfile.txt
   ```
   - `--detach-sign`: Generates a standalone signature.
   - Output: A file named `myfile.txt.asc` (or `myfile.txt.sig` without `--armor`).

3. **Specify a Specific Key (Optional)**
   If you have multiple keys and want to use a specific one, add the `--local-user` (or `-u`) option with the key ID or email:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --detach-sign -u 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 myfile.txt
   ```
   Or use the email:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --detach-sign -u alice@example.com myfile.txt
   ```

4. **Verify the Signature**
   To ensure the signing worked, verify it yourself:
   - For an embedded signature:
     ```bash
     gpg --verify myfile.txt.asc
     ```
   - For a detached signature:
     ```bash
     gpg --verify myfile.txt.asc myfile.txt
     ```
   Example output:
   ```
   gpg: Signature made Mon 03 Mar 2025 12:00:00 PM EST
   gpg:                using RSA key 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   gpg: Good signature from "Alice Smith <alice@example.com>" [ultimate]
   ```

5. **Share the Signed File**
   - If you used `--sign`, share `myfile.txt.asc` (or `.gpg`).
   - If you used `--detach-sign`, share both `myfile.txt` and `myfile.txt.asc`.
   - Recipients need your public key to verify the signature.

### Signing a Message (Instead of a File)
If you want to sign a message directly (e.g., for email):
1. Run:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --clearsign
   ```
2. Type your message, then press `Ctrl+D` (Unix) or `Ctrl+Z` (Windows) to finish.
3. Output will look like:
   ```
   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
   Hash: SHA256

   Hello, this is a signed message!
   -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
   ...
   -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
   ```

### Notes
- **Passphrase**: You’ll need to enter your key’s passphrase each time you sign unless it’s cached in `gpg-agent`.
- **Subkeys**: If you have a signing subkey (e.g., marked `[S]`), GPG may use it automatically. To force the primary key, use `-u` with the primary key ID.
- **Default Key**: Without `-u`, GPG uses the default key (usually the first secret key or one set in `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`).
- **Caching Passphrase**: If prompted repeatedly for a passphrase, configure `gpg-agent` for convenience (e.g., `gpg-agent --daemon`).
