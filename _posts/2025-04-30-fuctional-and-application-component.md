# Decomposing SaaS Functional and application compoenents

## Application components

Decomposing a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform like Qualtrics into its application components and functional components involves breaking down its architecture and capabilities into modular, logical units. Qualtrics is a complex experience management platform that provides survey creation, distribution, data collection, and analytics, with a robust API and management features. Below, I’ll outline how to decompose Qualtrics into **application components** (the technical building blocks of the system) and **functional components** (the user-facing features and capabilities), based on its known functionalities and typical SaaS architecture patterns.

mTLS
Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) is a security protocol that ensures bidirectional authentication between a client and a server during API communication. Unlike traditional TLS, which only requires the server to authenticate itself to the client, mTLS requires both parties to present and verify X.509 certificates, ensuring that only trusted clients can access the API. This is particularly valuable for business-to-business (B2B) applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and sensitive SaaS platforms like Qualtrics, where secure API access is critical.

Qualtrics supports mTLS as an advanced security option for its API, alongside features like IP allowlisting, to enhance the protection of data exchanged via its RESTful API (v3). Below, I provide a detailed explanation of mTLS for API access in the context of Qualtrics, followed by a step-by-step guide to set it up, based on available information and general best practices for mTLS implementation. Since Qualtrics’ documentation on mTLS setup is sparse, I’ll supplement with industry-standard approaches and note where Qualtrics-specific steps may require further inquiry.

---

### **Understanding mTLS for Qualtrics API Access**

#### **What is mTLS in the Context of Qualtrics?**
- **Purpose**: mTLS ensures that only authorized clients (e.g., applications or services) can make API requests to Qualtrics’ endpoints (e.g., `https://yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com/API/v3/surveys`). This is critical for protecting sensitive survey data, contact lists, and analytics.
- **Mechanism**: During the TLS handshake:
  - The Qualtrics server presents its certificate to the client, proving its identity.
  - The client presents its own X units (certificate) to the Qualtrics server, which verifies it against a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
  - Both certificates must be valid, signed by trusted CAs, and not revoked.
- **Use Cases**: mTLS is ideal for scenarios where Qualtrics API is integrated with enterprise systems (e.g., Salesforce, SAP) or IoT devices, ensuring that only pre-authorized clients can access or modify data.
- **Qualtrics-Specific Context**: Qualtrics mentions mTLS as an advanced security option on its API documentation site (`api.qualtrics.com`). It complements other security measures like API token authentication and IP allowlisting, providing an additional layer of client authentication.[](https://api.qualtrics.com/)

#### **Benefits of mTLS for Qualtrics API**
- **Enhanced Security**: Verifies the identity of both client and server, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Granular Access Control**: Allows Qualtrics administrators to restrict API access to specific clients with valid certificates.
- **Compliance**: Supports compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and FedRAMP, which Qualtrics adheres to, by ensuring secure data exchange.
- **No Dependency on Tokens Alone**: While Qualtrics API typically uses API tokens for authentication, mTLS adds a certificate-based layer, reducing reliance on token security.

#### **Challenges**
- **Complexity**: Setting up mTLS requires managing certificates, private keys, and trust stores, which can be complex for non-technical users.
- **Certificate Management**: Certificates must be issued, renewed, and revoked appropriately to maintain security.
- **Qualtrics-Specific Limitations**: Qualtrics does not provide detailed public documentation on mTLS setup, so some steps may require direct support from Qualtrics or a Brand Administrator.

---

### **How to Set Up mTLS for Qualtrics API Access**

Setting up mTLS for Qualtrics API access involves configuring both the client-side (your application or service) and server-side (Qualtrics’ API gateway) to exchange and verify certificates. Below is a step-by-step guide, combining Qualtrics-specific information with general mTLS best practices. Note that some steps may require coordination with Qualtrics support, as mTLS configuration details are not fully documented publicly.

#### **Step 1: Verify API Access and mTLS Support**
- **Check Qualtrics Account Permissions**:
  - Ensure your Qualtrics account has API access enabled. Free trial accounts typically do not include API access, and mTLS is an advanced feature likely restricted to paid plans (e.g., enterprise licenses).[](https://community.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-api-13/how-to-get-qualtrics-api-3497)
  - Contact your Qualtrics Brand Administrator or sales representative to confirm that your license includes mTLS support.[](https://help.qresearchsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/4427085383183-How-to-Import-Data-from-the-Qualtrics-API)
- **Access Qualtrics API Documentation**:
  - Visit `https://api.qualtrics.com` for the latest API reference, including security options like mTLS.[](https://api.qualtrics.com/)
  - Review the authentication section to understand how mTLS integrates with API token-based authentication.

#### **Step 2: Obtain or Generate Certificates**
- **Server Certificate (Qualtrics Side)**:
  - Qualtrics’ API server (`https://yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com/API`) already has a valid TLS certificate issued by a public CA. You don’t need to manage this certificate, as Qualtrics handles it.
- **Client Certificate (Your Side)**:
  - **Option 1: Use a Public CA**:
    - Request a client certificate from a trusted public CA (e.g., DigiCert, Let’s Encrypt, or AWS Certificate Manager).
    - The certificate should include your organization’s details (e.g., Common Name, Subject Alternative Name) and be compatible with Qualtrics’ trust store.
  - **Option 2: Use a Private CA**:
    - Create a private CA using tools like OpenSSL or AWS Private Certificate Authority.
    - Generate a client certificate signed by this CA. Example OpenSSL commands:
      ```bash
      # Create a private CA key and certificate
      openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
      openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 365 -out ca.crt

      # Generate client key and certificate signing request (CSR)
      openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
      openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr

      # Sign the client certificate with the CA
      openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365 -sha256
      ```
    - Store the client certificate (`client.crt`), private key (`client.key`), and CA certificate (`ca.crt`) securely.
  - **Option 3: Qualtrics-Managed CA**:
    - Qualtrics may provide a managed CA for issuing client certificates, especially for enterprise accounts. Contact Qualtrics support to inquire about this option.[](https://api.qualtrics.com/)
- **Trust Store Requirements**:
  - Qualtrics’ API gateway must trust the CA that issued your client certificate. If using a private CA, you’ll need to provide the CA certificate to Qualtrics (see Step 3).
  - Conversely, your client must trust the CA that issued Qualtrics’ server certificate (typically a public CA, so this is usually automatic).

#### **Step 3: Configure Qualtrics API Gateway for mTLS**
- **Submit CA Certificate to Qualtrics**:
  - If you’re using a private CA, you must add its certificate to Qualtrics’ trust store. This tells Qualtrics to accept client certificates signed by your CA.
  - Contact Qualtrics support or your Brand Administrator to upload the CA certificate (`ca.crt`). This step is not publicly documented, so direct communication with Qualtrics is necessary.[](https://api.qualtrics.com/)
- **Enable mTLS for Your API**:
  - Qualtrics’ API documentation mentions mTLS as an advanced security option, but specific configuration steps are not detailed.[](https://api.qualtrics.com/)
  - Request Qualtrics to enable mTLS for your API endpoints. You may need to specify:
    - The API base URL (e.g., `https://yourorganizationid.yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com/API`).
    - Optional constraints, such as requiring specific values in the client certificate’s Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or Common Name (e.g., `example.com`).[](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/APIGateway/Tasks/apigatewayaddingmtlssupport.htm)
  - Qualtrics may configure its API gateway to reject requests from clients without valid certificates.
- **Verify Configuration**:
  - Qualtrics should confirm that mTLS is enabled and provide any additional endpoint-specific settings (e.g., custom domain requirements).

#### **Step 4: Configure Your Client Application**
- **Install Client Certificate and Key**:
  - Store the client certificate (`client.crt`) and private key (`client.key`) on the client system (e.g., your application server or IoT device).
  - Ensure the private key is protected (e.g., restricted file permissions, encrypted storage).
- **Update API Client Code**:
  - Modify your API client to include the client certificate and key when making HTTPS requests to Qualtrics. Below are examples for common tools:
    - **cURL**:
      ```bash
      curl --cert client.crt --key client.key \
           -H "X-API-TOKEN: your_api_token" \
           https://yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com/API/v3/surveys
      ```
      - Use `--cacert ca.crt` if Qualtrics’ server certificate is signed by a private CA (unlikely).
    - **Python (requests library)**:
      ```python
      import requests

      url = "https://yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com/API/v3/surveys"
      headers = {"X-API-TOKEN": "your_api_token"}
      cert = ("client.crt", "client.key")

      response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, cert=cert, verify=True)
      print(response.json())
      ```
    - **Postman**:
      - Go to Settings > Certificates > Add Certificate.
      - Enter the Qualtrics API hostname (e.g., `yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com`).
      - Upload `client.crt` and `client.key`.
      - Add the API token in the Headers tab (`X-API-TOKEN`).
- **Handle Certificate Validation**:
  - Ensure your client validates Qualtrics’ server certificate (default behavior in most HTTPS clients).
  - If Qualtrics requires specific SAN or Common Name values in your client certificate, ensure they match your certificate’s configuration.[](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/APIGateway/Tasks/apigatewayaddingmtlssupport.htm)

#### **Step 5: Test the mTLS Configuration**
- **Make a Test API Request**:
  - Use a tool like cURL or Postman to send a test request to a Qualtrics API endpoint (e.g., `GET /v3/surveys`).
  - Example:
    ```bash
    curl --cert client.crt --key client.key \
         -H "X-API-TOKEN: your_api_token" \
         https://yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com/API/v3/surveys
    ```
  - Expected response: A `200 OK` status with JSON data if mTLS and API token authentication succeed.[](https://help.qresearchsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/4427085383183-How-to-Import-Data-from-the-Qualtrics-API)
  - Common errors:
    - `403 Forbidden`: Invalid or untrusted client certificate.
    - `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid API token.
    - `400 Bad Request`: Malformed request or incorrect endpoint.[](https://community.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-api-13/how-to-get-access-token-from-qualtrics-api-10736)
- **Test Without Client Certificate**:
  - Try the same request without the `--cert` and `--key` options:
    ```bash
    curl -H "X-API-TOKEN: your_api_token" \
         https://yourdatacenterid.qualtrics.com/API/v3/surveys
    ```
  - Expected response: A `403 Forbidden` or similar error, confirming that Qualtrics requires a client certificate for mTLS.
- **Debugging**:
  - Check Qualtrics’ API response for error details.
  - Use OpenSSL to verify certificate details:
    ```bash
    openssl x509 -in client.crt -text -noout
    ```
  - If issues persist, contact Qualtrics support with your certificate’s public details (not the private key) and error messages.

#### **Step 6: Manage Certificates and Monitor**
- **Certificate Renewal**:
  - Client certificates typically expire after 1–3 years. Set up a process to renew certificates before expiry to avoid disruptions.
  - Update the client certificate in your application and notify Qualtrics if the CA changes.
- **Certificate Revocation**:
  - If a client certificate is compromised, revoke it using your CA’s Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).
  - Inform Qualtrics to update its trust store if necessary. Qualtrics may not natively support CRL/OCSP, so confirm with support.[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/rest-api-mutual-tls.html)
- **Monitoring**:
  - Monitor API logs for failed authentication attempts, which could indicate misconfigured certificates or unauthorized access attempts.
  - Use Qualtrics’ dashboard or API response logs to track successful requests.

#### **Step 7: Integrate with Qualtrics API Token Authentication**
- **Combine mTLS with API Token**:
  - Qualtrics API requires an `X-API-TOKEN` header for authentication, even with mTLS.[](https://help.qresearchsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/4427085383183-How-to-Import-Data-from-the-Qualtrics-API)
  - Generate an API token in Qualtrics:
    1. Log in to Qualtrics.
    2. Go to Account Settings > Qualtrics IDs.
    3. Click “Generate Token” under the API section.[](https://developers.yale.edu/qualtrics-surveys)
  - Include the token in all API requests (see examples in Step 4).
- **Security Best Practice**:
  - Store the API token securely (e.g., in a vault like AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault).
  - Rotate tokens periodically and regenerate if compromised.

#### **Step 8: Optional – Use a Custom Domain (if Required)**
- **Custom Domain for mTLS**:
  - Qualtrics may require a custom domain for mTLS-enabled APIs, especially for enterprise accounts. This aligns with practices seen in other platforms like AWS API Gateway.[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/rest-api-mutual-tls.html)
  - If required, set up a custom domain (e.g., `api.yourorganization.com`) and associate it with Qualtrics’ API endpoint.
  - Configure DNS and upload a server certificate for the custom domain using a service like AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
- **Disable Default Endpoint**:
  - To enforce mTLS, disable Qualtrics’ default `execute-api` endpoint and route all traffic through the custom domain. Confirm with Qualtrics support if this is applicable.[](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/rest-api-mutual-tls.html)

### **Qualtrics-Specific Notes**
- **Limited Documentation**: Qualtrics’ public documentation briefly mentions mTLS but lacks detailed setup instructions. Most configuration details (e.g., trust store management, mTLS enablement) require direct interaction with Qualtrics support or a Brand Administrator.[](https://api.qualtrics.com/)
- **Enterprise Feature**: mTLS is likely restricted to enterprise or advanced plans. Verify with Qualtrics sales if your account supports it.
- **Integration with Existing Security**:
  - mTLS complements Qualtrics’ existing security features, such as IP allowlisting (restricting API access to specific IP ranges) and SSO for user authentication.
  - If using IP allowlisting, ensure your client’s IP is allowlisted in Qualtrics’ settings to avoid conflicts with mTLS.[](https://api.qualtrics.com/)
- **Support Channels**:
  - Contact Qualtrics support via the XM Community (`community.qualtrics.com`) or your account manager for mTLS-specific guidance.[](https://community.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-api-13)
  - Use the Qualtrics API Postman collection (`api.qualtrics.com`) to test mTLS-enabled requests.[](https://api.qualtrics.com/)

### **General Best Practices for mTLS**
- **Secure Private Keys**: Store client private keys in a hardware security module (HSM) or encrypted storage to prevent unauthorized access.[](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/restrict-api-access-with-client-certificates-mtls)
- **Validate Certificate Properties**:
  - Configure Qualtrics to check specific certificate fields (e.g., SAN, Common Name) for additional security.[](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/APIGateway/Tasks/apigatewayaddingmtlssupport.htm)
  - Avoid overly broad trust stores; only include necessary CAs.[](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/277449/using-mtls-for-api-access-control-and-authentication)
- **Automate Certificate Management**:
  - Use tools like Certbot or AWS ACM for automated certificate issuance and renewal.
  - Implement monitoring for certificate expiry using scripts or services like AWS Lambda.[](https://medium.com/contino-engineering/mtls-auth-with-aws-api-gateway-9bbd619f7de4)
- **Test Thoroughly**:
  - Test mTLS with multiple clients to ensure compatibility.
  - Simulate certificate revocation or invalid certificates to verify Qualtrics’ rejection behavior.[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/mtls/configure/)
- **Fallback Authentication**:
  - If mTLS setup fails, Qualtrics API requests can still use API tokens and IP allowlisting as a fallback, but this is less secure. Ensure mTLS is fully operational before relying on it exclusively.

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**
- **“403 Forbidden” Error**:
  - Cause: Invalid or untrusted client certificate.
  - Solution: Verify the certificate is signed by a CA trusted by Qualtrics. Check with Qualtrics support to ensure the CA certificate is in their trust store.
- **“401 Unauthorized” Error**:
  - Cause: Missing or invalid API token.
  - Solution: Ensure the `X-API-TOKEN` header is included and the token is valid. Regenerate the token if necessary.[](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30811271/qualtric-rest-api)
- **“400 Bad Request” Error**:
  - Cause: Malformed request or incorrect endpoint.
  - Solution: Validate the API endpoint and request format using Qualtrics’ API documentation or Postman collection.[](https://community.qualtrics.com/qualtrics-api-13/how-to-get-access-token-from-qualtrics-api-10736)
- **Certificate Validation Failure**:
  - Cause: Mismatch in certificate details (e.g., SAN, Common Name).
  - Solution: Update the certificate to match Qualtrics’ requirements or adjust Qualtrics’ validation rules via support.[](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/APIGateway/Tasks/apigatewayaddingmtlssupport.htm)
- **Connection Issues**:
  - Cause: Network or firewall blocking mTLS handshake.
  - Solution: Ensure your client’s IP is allowlisted (if Qualtrics uses IP restrictions) and that port 443 is open for HTTPS traffic.
