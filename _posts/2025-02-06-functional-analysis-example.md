Certainly! **Functional Analysis** in the context of **Information Technology (TI)** involves breaking down a system or application into its functional components to understand how it works, identify requirements, and ensure it meets user needs. Below is an example of a **Functional Analysis** for a **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System** in a TI context.

---

### **Example: Functional Analysis of a CRM System**

#### **1. Project Overview**
- **System Name**: CRM System
- **Purpose**: Manage customer interactions, track sales, and improve customer service.
- **Stakeholders**: Sales team, customer support team, IT department.

---

#### **2. Functional Requirements**
Functional requirements describe what the system should do. These are typically divided into **modules** or **features**.

| **Module**         | **Functional Requirements**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Management** | - Allow administrators to create, update, and delete user accounts.                        |
|                     | - Assign roles (e.g., sales rep, manager) and permissions to users.                        |
| **Customer Management** | - Add, edit, and delete customer records.                                           |
|                     | - Store customer contact information, purchase history, and preferences.                  |
| **Sales Management** | - Track sales opportunities and deals.                                                |
|                     | - Generate sales reports and forecasts.                                                   |
| **Support Management** | - Log and track customer support tickets.                                             |
|                     | - Assign tickets to support agents and monitor resolution times.                          |
| **Reporting**       | - Generate reports on sales performance, customer satisfaction, and support metrics.      |
|                     | - Export reports in PDF, Excel, or CSV formats.                                           |

#### **3. Use Cases**
Use cases describe how users interact with the system.

| **Use Case**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create Customer Record**   | A sales representative adds a new customer to the system.                      |
| **Update Sales Opportunity** | A manager updates the status of a sales opportunity (e.g., from "Prospect" to "Closed-Won"). |
| **Generate Sales Report**    | A manager generates a monthly sales report to analyze performance.              |
| **Assign Support Ticket**    | A support manager assigns a ticket to an agent based on workload and expertise. |

---

#### **4. Data Flow Diagrams**
Data flow diagrams (DFDs) show how data moves through the system.

- **Level 0 (Context Diagram)**:
  ```
  +-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
  |   Sales Team      |       |   Support Team    |       |   Admin Team      |
  +-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
            |                           |                           |
            v                           v                           v
  +---------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                       CRM System                              |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------+
            |                           |                           |
            v                           v                           v
  +-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
  |   Database        |       |   Reporting Tool  |       |   Email Service   |
  +-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-------------------+
  ```

- **Level 1 (Detailed DFD)**:
  - Shows how data flows within the CRM system (e.g., customer data â†’ sales module â†’ database).
