This post will guide and help you how to use gpg. jmc
## Prerequistes

 - gpg installed;

if not installed
```console
$ apt update && install -y gpg
```

Otherweise if you have docker installed so you can play with it in debian container

```console
$ docker run -ti --rm --name debian debian
```
in the container install gpg

```console
$ apt update && apt install -y vim less tree gpg
```

## CLI

### Get gpg version

```console
$ gpg --version
```

`Output`

```console
$ gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.27
$ libgcrypt 1.8.8
$ Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
$ License GNU GPL-3.0-or-later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
$ This is free software: you are ...
$ ...
```

### Get public and secret keys list

Public keys
:
```console
$ gpg -k
```

Public with key value
:
```console
$ gpg --list-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

Secret keys
:
```console
$ gpg -K
```

Secret with key value
:
```console
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

### Create key

```console
$ gpg --full-generate-key
```

```console
$ gpg --full-gen-key
```
you have to select one option (by default 1)
you have to set keysize (between 1024 and 4096 bits)
specify how long the key should be valid
specify name and email ...

## SIGN

### sign with sha

```console
$ sha1sum test.txt 
```

### Sign with gpg
- encapslated in one file (signature + file)

```console
$ gpg --clearsign filename

$ gpg --sign test.txt 
```
- seperate the signature from the file

```console
$ gpg --detach-sign test.txt 
```

#### to verify the signature

```console
$ gpg --verify test.txt.gpg 

$ gpg --verify test.txt.sig 
```


## ENCRYPT

```console
$ gpg -r <uidName> --armor --encrypt <fileName>

$ gpg -r meddjerc --armor --encrypt mesTodo.txt

$ gpg -e -a -r mohamedchamseddine.jerbi@proton.me file.txt 

$ gpg -e -a -r 0x32424D1AD356BE8E file.txt 
```
- `-e` to encrypt
- `-r` specific key (jmc@mail.com or id form `gpg -k` command)
- `-a` in ascii and not byte format

## DECRYPT

```console
$ gpg -d <fileName>

$ gpg -d mesTodo.asc

$ gpg -d -o file.txt file.txt.asc 
```
`-o` output file

## MANAGE KEYS

```console
$ gpg --expert --edit-key meddjerc
```


### Add subkey

```console
$ gpg> addkey
```

To change key's validity, you have to select the key and tape expire:
```console
$ gpg -K
```

## EXPORT KEYS

### Exporting a GPG private subkey and primary key
Exporting a GPG **private subkey** and **primary key** requires extra care, as these are sensitive cryptographic materials that should be kept secure. The `gpg` command-line tool allows you to export private keys (including subkeys) in a format that can be imported elsewhere. Below are the steps to do this.

### Steps to Export GPG Private Subkey and Primary Key

1. **List Your Keys**
   First, identify the key pair you want to export. Run:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-secret-keys
   ```
   Example output:
   ```
   sec   rsa4096 2023-01-15 [SC] [expires: 2025-01-15]
         1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   ssb   rsa2048 2023-01-15 [E]
         FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98
   ```
   - `sec` is the primary secret key (e.g., `1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678`).
   - `ssb` is the secret subkey (e.g., `FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98`).

2. **Export the Private Primary Key and Subkey**
   To export both the private primary key and its associated subkeys, use the `--export-secret-keys` option with the primary key ID:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export-secret-keys 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 > myprivatekey.asc
   ```
   - `--armor`: Outputs the key in ASCII-armored format (readable text).
   - `--export-secret-keys`: Exports the private key (including subkeys by default).
   - `> myprivatekey.asc`: Saves the output to a file.

   If your key is passphrase-protected (which it should be), you’ll be prompted to enter the passphrase.

3. **Export Only the Private Subkey (Optional)**
   If you want to export *only* the private subkey (without the primary key), use the subkey ID with an exclamation mark (`!`):
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export-secret-keys FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98! > mysubkey_private.asc
   ```
   - The `!` ensures only the specified subkey is exported, not the primary key or other subkeys.

   Again, enter the passphrase if prompted.

4. **Verify the Exported File**
   Check the file to ensure it was exported correctly:
   ```bash
   cat myprivatekey.asc
   ```
   It should start with:
   ```
   -----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
   ...
   -----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
   ```

5. **Secure the Exported File**
   Private keys are sensitive! Protect the exported file:
   - Store it in a secure location (e.g., encrypted drive).
   - Optionally, encrypt it with a new passphrase using:
     ```bash
     gpg --armor --output myprivatekey.asc.gpg --symmetric myprivatekey.asc
     ```
     This creates an encrypted version (`myprivatekey.asc.gpg`) with a new passphrase.

### Important Notes
- **Passphrase**: If your key is protected (as it should be), you’ll need the passphrase to export or use it later.
- **Subkey Inclusion**: By default, `--export-secret-keys` with the primary key ID exports the primary key *and all associated subkeys*. Use the `!` syntax to isolate a specific subkey.
- **Backup**: Exporting private keys is typically for backup or migration (e.g., moving to a new machine). Avoid unnecessary exports.
- **Revocation**: If the exported private key is compromised, ensure you have a revocation certificate ready to invalidate it.

### Example Workflow
- Export primary key + subkeys:
  ```bash
  gpg --armor --export-secret-keys 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 > myfullkey.asc
  ```
- Export only a subkey:
  ```bash
  gpg --armor --export-secret-keys FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98! > mysubkey.asc
  ```

### Exporting a GPG public subkey and primary key

To export a GPG public subkey, you'll need to use the `gpg` command-line tool. Below are the steps to do this. I'll assume you have GPG installed and have already generated a key pair with subkeys. If not, let me know, and I can guide you through that as well!

### Steps to Export a GPG Public Subkey

1. **List Your Keys**
   First, identify the key and subkey you want to export. Run the following command to list all keys in your keyring:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-keys
   ```
   This will display something like:
   ```
   pub   rsa4096 2023-01-15 [SC] [expires: 2025-01-15]
         1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   uid           [ultimate] Your Name <your.email@example.com>
   sub   rsa2048 2023-01-15 [E]
   ```
   - `pub` is your primary key.
   - `sub` is your subkey (e.g., for encryption `[E]` or signing `[S]`).
   - Note the key ID (e.g., `1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678`).

2. **Export the Public Subkey**
   To export only the public subkey (not the primary key), use the `--export` option with the subkey ID. Subkeys are often referenced by appending an exclamation mark (`!`) to the key ID to ensure only the subkey is exported. However, you'll need to identify the specific subkey ID first.

   Run this to list the keys with more detail, including subkey IDs:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-keys --with-subkey-fingerprints
   ```
   Output might look like:
   ```
   pub   rsa4096 2023-01-15 [SC] [expires: 2025-01-15]
         1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   uid           [ultimate] Your Name <your.email@example.com>
   sub   rsa2048 2023-01-15 [E]
         FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98
   ```
   Here, `FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98` is the subkey's fingerprint.

   Now, export the subkey:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98! > mysubkey.pub
   ```
   - `--armor`: Outputs the key in ASCII-armored format (readable text).
   - `!`: Ensures only the subkey is exported, not the primary key.
   - `> mysubkey.pub`: Saves the output to a file (e.g., `mysubkey.pub`).

3. **Verify the Exported Subkey**
   Check the exported file:
   ```bash
   cat mysubkey.pub
   ```
   It should look like a standard GPG public key block but only contain the subkey data.

4. **Optional: Export All Subkeys**
   If you want to export all subkeys along with the primary key, simply use the primary key ID without the `!`:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678 > mykey_with_subkeys.pub
   ```

### Notes
- Replace the key IDs with your actual key/subkey fingerprints.
- If you’re unsure which subkey to export (e.g., encryption vs. signing), the `[E]` or `[S]` in the output of `--list-keys` indicates its purpose.
- The exported file (`mysubkey.pub`) can be shared with others to allow them to use your subkey (e.g., for encryption).





## IMPORT KEYS

To import a GPG public subkey, you’ll use the `gpg` command-line tool to add it to your keyring. This assumes you have a file containing the public subkey (e.g., exported as described earlier). Below are the steps to import it.

### Steps to Import a GPG Public Subkey

1. **Obtain the Public Subkey File**
   Ensure you have the file containing the public subkey you want to import. For example, it might be named `mysubkey.pub` and contain an ASCII-armored public key block that looks like this:
   ```
   -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
   ...
   -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
   ```

2. **Import the Subkey**
   Use the `gpg --import` command to add the subkey to your keyring:
   ```bash
   gpg --import mysubkey.pub
   ```
   - Replace `mysubkey.pub` with the actual filename.

   Example output:
   ```
   gpg: key 1234567890ABCDEF12345678: public key "Your Name <your.email@example.com>" imported
   gpg: key FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98: subkey imported
   gpg: Total number processed: 1
   gpg:               imported: 1
   ```

3. **Verify the Import**
   Check that the subkey has been added to your keyring by listing your keys:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-keys
   ```
   Or, for more detail including subkeys:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-keys --with-subkey-fingerprints
   ```
   Look for the subkey’s fingerprint (e.g., `FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98`) under the primary key it belongs to. The output might look like:
   ```
   pub   rsa4096 2023-01-15 [SC] [expires: 2025-01-15]
         1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   uid           [ultimate] Your Name <your.email@example.com>
   sub   rsa2048 2023-01-15 [E]
         FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA9876543210FEDCBA98
   ```

4. **Trust the Key (Optional)**
   If this subkey belongs to someone else’s key and you want to use it (e.g., for encryption or verification), you may need to assign a trust level:
   ```bash
   gpg --edit-key 1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   ```
   Inside the GPG interactive prompt:
   - Type `trust` and follow the prompts to set a trust level (e.g., "marginal" or "full").
   - Type `quit` to exit.

### Notes
- The subkey will be associated with its primary key if the primary key is already in your keyring. If the primary key isn’t present, GPG will still import the subkey, but it may appear as an orphan until the primary key is imported.
- If the subkey file contains multiple keys or subkeys, `gpg --import` will process all of them.
- If you encounter an error (e.g., "not a key"), ensure the file is a valid GPG public key block.



## DELETE KEYS

> You have to delete the secret before the public key.
{: .prompt-warning }

```console
$ gpg --delete-secret-keys mohamedchamseddine.jerbi@proton.me

$ gpg --delete-secret-keys 0xCFB96EEE8C837DDA

$ gpg --delete-keys mohamedchaseddine.jerbi@proton.me
```

> To exit from mutliline `insert` command, tape `Ctrl+D`.
{: .prompt-tip }

> keys are saved in ~/.gnupg/
{: .prompt-tip }

## Change passphrase

```console
$ gpg --passwd usename@mail.com
```
- you have to put your current passphrase and after the new one.

## REVOKE KEY

go to location where your located revoke file

```console
$ gpg --import revoke-file-name
```


## EDIT KEY

> Unable to monitor directories for changes because iNotify max watches exceeded.
{: .prompt-danger }

Run these commands from the host (not in the docker container)
```console
$ gpg --edit-key mohamedchamseddine.jerbi@proton.me
```
- you have to select wich key you want to edit (key 0, key 1 ...)
- to chage validity tape `expire`
- don't forget to `save` before quit
